# AESHA3

Nowadays, cybersecurity has become an important issue. Therefore, encryption and
verification of messages should be taken seriously. The AES (Advanced Encryption
Standard) algorithm is a symmetric block cipher of the Computer Security Standard
Cryptography adopted by USA federal, which can encrypt (encipher) and decrypt
(decipher) information and is widely adopted worldwide. The SHA-3 (Secure Hash
Algorithm-3) is a secure hash function selected by NIST, which aims to prevent from
deriving input directly by hash value because of its collision resistance. **The design
goal of this chip is to implement multiple Cryptography features in a single chip
including encryption, decryption, signature and verification**.
